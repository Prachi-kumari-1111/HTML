Greetings,<span> I'm Maya,</span> a seeker of beauty and meaning in the world of art. 
From my earliest memories, I've been enchanted by the world of colors and forms. 
Growing up in Mexico, I was surrounded by the picturesque landscapes of Beauty and dreamy scenes,
which instilled in me a deep appreciation for nature's beauty.<br>
</br>

Painting became not just a hobby, but a way for me to capture the essence of the world around me and convey the emotions within.
It's a journey of self-discovery and a constant quest to translate the intangible into the tangible.
With every brushstroke, I rediscover a piece of myself.<br>
</br>

In essence, I am driven to paint by a profound love for the world around me, a desire to capture its beauty,
and an unquenchable thirst for self-expression through the medium of art. Through my paintings,
I hope to share a piece of my world and touch the hearts of those who view them.

        <h1>1. Inspiration</h1>
    <p>Every painting begins with an idea or a spark of inspiration. 
        It might be a vivid dream, a fleeting moment in nature, or an intense emotion. 
        I keep a sketchbook handy to jot down these moments of inspiration, 
        which often serve as the foundation for my artwork.</p>

        <h1>2. Conceptualization</h1>
    <p>Once I have a clear idea, I begin sketching rough outlines and visualizing the composition.
         This stage is all about finding the right balance, deciding on the color palette,
          and mapping out the key elements.
