            <h2>WHAT WE DO</h2>
            <p>Schoolhouse.world is a platform for free, peer-to-peer tutoring—where anyone, anywhere can receive live help, build their skills, and pay it forward by becoming a tutor themselves.</p>
            <p>When schools transitioned to online learning during COVID-19 and students around the world craved more social interaction, access to personalized help became more inequitable than ever.</p>
            <p>This prompted Sal Khan (founder of Khan Academy) to partner with his college friend, Shishir Mehrotra (co-founder and CEO of Coda), to create Schoolhouse.world.</p>
            <p>With Mariah Olson, Drew Bent, and a handful of volunteers, they launched a pilot platform built on Coda to provide high-quality virtual tutoring to thousands of learners—completely for free.</p>
            <p>Now, Schoolhouse.world reaches learners from over 100+ countries, and is proud to foster a vibrant community of over 15310+ volunteer tutors and 118500+ learners. We’re driven by our mission to connect hundreds of thousands of more learners with safe, equitable opportunities to learn, teach, and grow.</p>
