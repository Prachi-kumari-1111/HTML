<p class="p1"> When schools transitioned to online learning during COVID-19 and students around <br>
                the world craved more social interaction, access to personalized help become <br>
                more inequitable than ever.</p>
    
  <p class="p2">This prompted Sal Khan (founder of Khan Academy) to partner with his college friend,<br>
                Shishir Mehrotra (co-founder and CEO of Coda), to create Schoolhouse.world.</p>
    
<p class="p3">With Mariah Olson, Drew Bent, and a handful of volunteers, they launched a pilot<br>
              platform built on Coda to provide high-quality virtual tutoring to thousands of<br>
              learners–completely for free.</p>
    
<p class="p4">Now, Schoolhouse.world reaches learners from over 100+ countries, and is proud to<br>
              foster a vibrant community of over 15310+ volunteer tutors and 118500+ learners.<br>
              We’re driven by our mission to connect hundreds of thousands of more learners with<br>
              safe, equitable opportunities to learn, teach, and grow.</p>
